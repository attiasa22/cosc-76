Write:
1. a report to discuss your implementation, which contains the following information:
  a. Header with the code of the class, the term, and year, the assignment number, and your name.
  b. A short typewritten report describing your results. The report should contain three main sections:
    (a) Description: How do your implemented algorithms work? What design decisions did you make? How you laid out the problems?
    (b) Evaluation: Do your implemented algorithms actually work? How well? If it doesnâ€™t work, can you tell why not? What partial successes did you have that deserve partial credit? Include a comparison of running time results using different heuristics and inference.
    (c) Responses to discussion questions that are included within the points in "Required tasks" and the following point:
        - Lossy chickens and foxes: Every fox knows the saying that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.  What if, in the service of their faith, some chickens were willing to be made into lunch?  Let us design a problem where no more than E chickens could be eaten, where E is some constant.  What would the state for this problem be?  What changes would you have to make to your code to implement a solution?  Give an upper bound on the number of possible states for this problem.  (You need not implement anything here.)

a README file with the instructions on how to execute the program.
Please write your report in Markdown in report.md. Then use pandoc or something similar to generate a pdf. (If you are having trouble with this step, just leave it in Markdown.) Include both files in your submission, as well as all figures (as pdf).
